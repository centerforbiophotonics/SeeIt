  1.added piechart option into application_controller.js.coffee
  2.revised pie_chart.js(basically some little changes). 
    http://nvd3.org/examples/pie.html
    â†‘good sample
  3.bug#1: while adding data into graph, console.log: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
    the error which is linked to getKey(d).length which return the length of data.key. Even though defined the key in
    formatData, it still not work.
  4.bug#2: graph.chartObject = chart
        	 return chart
        	 which are the last two statements inside the nv.addGraph function in the draw function, they will result problems
        	 loading into SeeIt web page---Action controller:Exception caught
  5.future plans: debug. Then, I used some sample data instead of loading from the provided one, the piechart could show up but
    each time I trigger a legend, the size of the circle will be get smaller or bigger depending on cancel/selet. So basically 
    this is a bug as well.
